# Password-Generator

## Javascript Password Generator

My motivation today is to create a password generator that utilizes lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters. The Javascript will create a randomized password that will have a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters. For this to be achieved the following must be answered:
 
 
* When the buttom is clicked a series of prompts for password criteria must be shown
* The user must be able to select which type of criteria to include in the password
* The length of the password must be at least 8 characters or 128 characters or else return null
* After each input is confirmed the input should be validated and one character type should be selected
* The password is generated that matches the selected criteria and is displayed or written to the page

## Usage
This is to demonstrate the usage of javascript to produce a random password to be used.
